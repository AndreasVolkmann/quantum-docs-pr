# Contributing to the Quantum Development Kit #

The Quantum Development Kit is more than a collection of tools for writing quantum programs.
It's part of a broad community of people discovering quantum computing, performing research in quantum algorithms, developing new applications for quantum devices, and otherwise working to make the most out of the quantum programming.
As a member of that community, the Quantum Development Kit aims to offer quantum developers across a wide range of backgrounds with the features they need.
Your contributions to the Quantum Development Kit help in realizing that goal by improving the tools used by other quantum developers, how those tools are documented, and even by creating new features and functionality that helps make the entire quantum programming community a better place to discover and create.
We're very thankful for your kind contributions, and for the opportunity to work with you to make our community the best that it can be.

In this guide, we provide some advice on how to make a contribution that...
