## Opening Pull Requests ##

All of the documentation for the Quantum Development Kit is managed using the Git version control system through the use of several repositories hosted on GitHub.
Using Git and GitHub together makes it easy to collaborate widely on the Quantum Development Kit.
In particular, any Git repository can be cloned or forked to make a completely independent copy of that repository.
This allows you to work on your contribution with the tools and at a pace that you prefer.

When you're ready, you can send us a request to include your contribution into our repos, using GitHub's _pull request_ functionality.
The page for each pull request includes details of all the changes that make your contribution, a list of comments on your contribution, and a set of review tools that other members of the community can use to provide feedback and advice.

While a full tutorial on Git is beyond the scope of this guide, we can suggest the following links for more resources on learning Git:

- **TODO**

**TODO: describe lightweight (web-based) for small changes, links to GitHub Flow for more extensive work.**

**TODO: PR ettiquette, reviews, etc.**
